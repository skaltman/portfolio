## Description

This is the solution to an assignment I created for Stanford's ENGR 150: Data Challenge Lab in winter 2017. I used the data available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N9mMdh2X47AfmDJ4XEw8CDe5CL5O6mfI3KPnzERaplk/edit), which was compiled by Holden Karnofsky at GiveWell.
